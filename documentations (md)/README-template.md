# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

## The challenge
The challenge is to build an interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
